# emissions_probability

The purpose of this script is to both visualize leak count and emissions from empirical leak distributions. main_emis will generate % of total emissions from a distribution at each leak rate, and main_cdf willl generate both % of total emissions and total leaks. By default, emissions profiles from Zavala Araiza (2015), Clearstone (2018), Fort Worth Air Quality Study (2011), and parameters from Alvarez (2018) can be used.
